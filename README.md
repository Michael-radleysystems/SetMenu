# SetMenu
An Etal for controlling set menu use

This script is build to allow the restaurant owner more control over set menus while keeping printing consistent with the normal menu.
It uses the concept that each course is zero priced (with supplements on the relevant courses) and a set menu PLU to be used for charging the courses.

To use this script you need to enable it in the script setting.
When using this script you will need to set up 3 departments. One linked to your Set Menu Starters and Dessert of PLU's, these should be unique and zero priced.
One linked to your Set Menu Main PLU's, these should have supplements where need and be unique.
One Linked to your Set Menu Priced PLU's these will apply the price to the sale and the value in the 4th @ price will give the number of available course.
ie. 0.02 is two courses one starter or desert and one main. 0.03 is three course one or two of a starter and dessert plus one Main.
